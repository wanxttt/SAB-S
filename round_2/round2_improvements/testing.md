TESTING & VALIDATION – ROUND 2

1. UNIT TESTING

LCR Sensor Validation

Direction detection accuracy verified up to a range of 10 meters.

Achieved 100% correct directional detection across 20 controlled test cases.

Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection

Obstacle types included shoes, pets, and household furniture.

Successfully avoided obstacles in 49 out of 50 trials.

Overall obstacle avoidance success rate measured at 98%.

Servo-Based Medicine Dispensing

Servo mechanism tested for controlled dose release.

Exactly one medicine dose released per cycle.

Validated over 50 consecutive dispensing cycles with zero failures.

2. INTEGRATION TESTING

End-to-End System Cycle

Complete operational flow tested: alert generation → robot movement → medicine dispensing.

Average execution time recorded as 45 seconds.

Testing environment consisted of a two-room residential setup.

Mobile Application Synchronization

Medicine stock data updated automatically after each dispensing event.

Stock update reflected in the mobile application within less than 2 seconds.

Low-Stock Alert Mechanism

Threshold configured for remaining stock below three days.

Alert triggered correctly in all test scenarios.

3. EDGE CASE TESTING

Path Obstruction Handling

Robot tested with intentional obstacles blocking the predefined path.

Dynamic rerouting executed successfully in 95% of the cases.

Weak or Lost Signal Conditions

Robot immediately halted movement upon signal degradation.

Safe retry mechanism initiated once signal strength was restored.

Low Battery Scenario

Battery threshold detection tested under low-charge conditions.

Robot paused delivery operation safely.

Alert notification sent to caregiver without delay.

4. REAL-WORLD VALIDATION

Residential Environment Testing

System tested in a real home environment.

Delivery path covered navigation from living room to bedroom.

User Accessibility Evaluation

Medicine dispensing box height optimized for seated users.

Comfortable access confirmed during real-user trials.

Caregiver Notification Verification

Mobile notification sent after every successful medicine delivery.

Zero missed notifications recorded during testing.

5. OVERALL PERFORMANCE RESULTS

Overall system success rate recorded as 98%.

Average medicine delivery time measured at 45 seconds per operation.

System tested on mixed flooring surfaces including tiles and rugs.

Navigation, dispensing, and alert subsystems demonstrated stable performance across all environments.
