Project Overview: The Heart of AiVa-:
AiVa is a proactive assistive robot built to tackle medication non-adherence—a serious health risk that many seniors, people with chronic conditions, and those with limited mobility face every day.

The Problem We’re Solving-:
Most current tools, like pill organizers or phone alarms, are "passive." They can remind you it’s time for your medicine, but they can't help you actually get it. This gap often leads to:

Forgotten Doses: It’s easy to overlook a reminder when you're distracted or dealing with memory loss.

Confusion: Uncertainty about whether a dose was already taken can lead to dangerous double-dosing.

Physical Risks: For those who struggle to walk, moving across the house to reach a medicine cabinet increases the risk of a fall.

Caregiver Stress: Family members often worry constantly when they can’t be there to supervise every dose.

The AiVa Solution-:
AiVa changes the game by turning a passive reminder into an active delivery. Instead of waiting for the patient to come to the medicine, the robot physically brings the correct dose directly to the patient, no matter where they are in the house.

Key Features:
Finding the Patient Naturally: Using smart sensors and a comfortable wearable wristband, AiVa finds your exact location in real-time. You don’t need to follow a set path or pre-program a map.

Meaningful Reminders: AiVa uses both sound and light to get your attention. These stay active until you acknowledge them, making sure the medicine is actually taken, not just dropped off.

Safe, Effortless Delivery: The robot moves on its own, carefully avoiding furniture and pets. It presents the medicine at an easy-to-reach height, so there’s no need to struggle with cabinets or walk while feeling unsteady.

Staying Connected: Through a dedicated mobile app, caregivers can monitor everything in real-time—from getting low-stock alerts and checking delivery logs to scanning new medicine labels effortlessly.

Why AiVa is Different?
AiVa stands out because it is mobile, adaptive, and designed specifically around the patient’s needs. It meets people exactly where they are, removes the chance for human error, and provides a reliable safety net for both patients and their loved ones.

AiVa — Where AI Meets Human Care Proactive. Safe. Reliable. — Bringing medicine to people, not people to medicine.
